    "description": "Alternative metal is a genre of heavy metal that gained popularity in the early 1990s and combines Heavy Metal with Alternative Rock. Most notably, alternative metal bands are characterized by heavy guitar riffs; typically, these riffs have a pronounced experimental edge, including unconventional lyrics, odd time signatures, more syncopation than typical metal, unusual technique, a resistance to conventional approaches to heavy music and an incorporation of a wide range of influences outside of the metal music scene.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_metal\">(Source)</a>",

Typically the electric guitar is played together with synthesizers and keyboards, or simply in an 'atmospheric' style with much use of reverb. <br><br>The Norwegian artist Varg Vikernes with his one man band Burzum, may be considered a pioneer of black ambient (having also performed in traditional dark ambient). During his time in prison, Vikernes recorded two albums (Dauði Baldrs and Hliðskjálf), which are composed of dark ambient songs. Vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar, bass guitar or drums, and instead used a synthesizer and a tape recorder.\n<br><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient\">(Source)</a>",

There are often bands out there who do not completely fit into either Black Metal or Death Metal. These bands fall into what the metal community calls blackened death metal. It is traditionally a mix between the two styles. Basically, blackened death metal tends to have the death grunts mixed in with black metal playing styles. Other times, you will hear the black metal style blast beat accompanied with death grunts or the slow pounding guitar rhythms. It is sometimes described as a catch all for the bands that do not fall into one of the two parent genres specifically. <br>\n<a href=\"http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Blackened+Death+Metal/\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Blues rock bands \"borrow[ed] the idea of an instrumental combo and loud amplification from rock & roll\". It is also often played at a fast tempo, again distinguishing it from the blues. The core of the blues rock sound is created by the electric guitar, bass guitar and drum kit, with the electric guitar usually amplified through a tube guitar amplifier, giving it an overdriven character.\n<br><br>\nThe style began to develop in the mid-1960s in England and the United States, as what Piero Scaruffi called, a \"genre of rhythm'n'blues played by white European musicians\". While the early blues-rock bands \"attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records\", by the 1970s, blues rock got heavier and more riff-based. By the \"early '70s, the lines between blues-rock and hard rock were barely visible\", as bands began recording rock-style albums.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The early pioneers of the genre were the three Irish bands Cruachan, Primordial and Waylander. The genre has since expanded beyond Irish shores and is known to be performed today by bands from numerous other countries.\n<br><br>\nSimilar to its parent genre of folk metal, the music of Celtic metal is a diverse collection with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music. While bands some bands ply their trade with the more extreme subgenres of black or death metal, other groups prefer a more traditional or power metal sound. The one common element is a shared interest in incorporating Celtic music into heavy metal.\n<br><br>\nMany bands in the genre enhance their sound with the use of a folk instrument. Such as the fiddle, the tin whistle and the flute. A number of the Irish bands of the genre make use of native instruments such as the uilleann pipe and bodhrán.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Crossover thrash metal, often abbreviated to crossover, is a form of thrash metal that contains more hardcore punk elements than standard thrash. It is sometimes referred to as punk metal, though this is generally incorrect due to the existence of other music genres that combine forms of punk rock and heavy metal, such as grunge and crust punk. While thrash metal is heavily influenced by hardcore punk, the overall sound of crossover thrash is more punk-influenced yet more metal-sounding and aggressive than traditional hardcore punk and thrashcore.\n<br><br>\nCrossover thrash evolved when performers in hardcore punk and heavy metal began borrowing elements of one another's music. Punk-based metal bands generally evolved into the genre by developing more musical technique than the average hardcore outfit, and getting bored with the musical limitations of \"pure\" hardcore (which focused on very fast tempos and very brief songs). Especially early on, crossover thrash had a strong affinity with skate punk, but gradually became more and more the province of metal audiences.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_thrash\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The style, which evolved in the mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The lyrical content of crust punk tends to be bleak and nihilistic, yet politically engaged. Crust punk songs are often about nuclear war, militarism, animal rights, police, personal grievances and oppressive states and fascism. Amebix were also interested in various forms of mysticism and Gnosticism.\n<br><br>\nCrust is partly defined by its \"bassy\" and \"dirty\" sound. It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually guttural and may be growled or screamed. Crust punk takes cues from the anarcho-punk of Crass and Discharge, the extreme metal of bands like Venom and Celtic Frost and, in some of its more dissonant strains, subtle elements of post-punk via Killing Joke. Crust punk has always remained a deeply underground form of music, although fans of the style are found worldwide.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_punk\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Dark ambient is an unusually diverse genre, related to industrial music, noise, ethereal wave, and black metal, yet generally free from derivatives and connections to other genres or styles.<br><br>\n\nGenerally the music tends to evoke a feeling of solitude, melancholy, confinement, and isolation.

It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes.\n<br><br>\nBuilding from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid 1980s. English heavy metal band Venom crystallized the elements of what later became known as thrash metal, death metal and black metal, with their 1981 album Welcome to Hell. Their dark, blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands. Metal acts such as Slayer, Kreator, Celtic Frost were very important influences to the crafting of the genre. Along with the band Death and its frontman Chuck Schuldiner, who is often referred to as \"the father of death metal\", bands such as Possessed, Obituary and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre. \n<br><br>\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular record labels like Earache and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate. Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning a variety of subgenres.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The achieved effect is that of death metal's trademark combination of gruff vocals and highly distorted detuned guitar riffing with elements reminiscent of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.\n<br><br>\nWhile \"death 'n' roll\" tag was first associated with Entombed, Daniel Ekeroth associates the style with a previous group called Furbowl. After Entombed's breakthrough release, Wolverine Blues, the band became associated with what the music press dubbed as \"death 'n' roll\", a label which has followed Entombed's career ever since.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_%27n%27_roll\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Doom metal is an extreme form of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \"thicker\" or \"heavier\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. Doom metal is among the oldest forms of heavy metal, rooted in the music of early Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath's music is itself stylistically rooted in blues, but with the deliberately doomy and loud guitar playing of Tony Iommi (who often used the tritone), and the then-uncommon dark and pessimistic lyrics and atmosphere, they set the standards of early heavy metal and inspired various doom metal bands to come. \n<br><br>\nIn the early 1970s both Black Sabbath and the American band Pentagram composed and performed this heavy and dark music, which would in the 1980s begin to be known and referred to as doom metal by subsequent musicians, critics and fans. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England, the United States and Sweden defined doom metal as a distinct genre. Slower, heavier and pessimistic in its nature, doom metal bands did not receive much attention even among die-hard metal fans of that time.\n<br><br>\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, experimentation within doom metal became widespread, and the genre diversified as a result. Today, bands who continue the style of the genre's pioneers are often referred to as traditional doom metal. Traditional doom metal bands more commonly use higher guitar tunings, and do not play as slow as many other doom bands. Traditional doom bands typically play slow to mid-tempo songs with a thick and heavy sound. Vocals are usually clean with the occasional growl or scream. The lyrics in traditional doom usually are eerie and dark like other doom metal divisions.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone doom is generally influenced by drone music, noise music and minimalist music.

    "description": "Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It often uses fast tempos, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, raw recording, and unconventional song structure.\n<br><br>\nThe first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often speed metal or thrash metal bands. The term \"black metal\" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album Black Metal (1982). Although considered thrash metal rather than black metal by modern standards, the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was unpolished in production and featured raspy grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.\n<br><br>\nAnother major influence on black metal was the Swedish band Bathory, led by Thomas Forsberg (under the pseudonym Quorthon). Not only did Bathory use unpolished production and anti-Christian themes, but Quorthon was also the first to use the \"shrieked\" vocals that came to define black metal.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal#The_First_Wave\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

During the 1960s, it was not recognized as a separate music genre and had no specific name. In the late 1970s, some rock critics retroactively identified it as an early incarnation of punk rock, and it is sometimes called garage punk, protopunk, or 1960s punk; however, the music style has predominantly been referred to as garage rock.\n<br><br>\nThe garage rock performances were most of the time characterized as being amateurish or naïve. Common themes were related to the negative aspects of high school life and the lyrics and delivery were quite a bit more aggressive than what was common at the time, often with growled or shouted vocals that often seemed to be more like screaming. A particularly common type of songs were songs about \"lying girls\". This might imply that the music was very limited. However, in reality different garage rock acts were quite diverse in both musical ability and in style. Bands varied from one-chord musical crudeness to near-studio musician quality. Also there were regional variations in many parts of the country with the Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon having the most defined regional sound.\n<br><br>\nBy 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and the local level as new styles had evolved to replace garage rock and since the music industry stopped supporting it. The only exception was in Detroit where garage rock stayed alive until the early 70s, however, with a much more aggressive style. These bands are often described as proto-punk or proto-hard rock.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://ezinearticles.com/?The-History-of-Garage-Rock&id=1939795\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, combining the flamboyant look of glam rock and playing a power-chord-based heavy metal musical style.\n<br><br>\nMusically, glam metal uses traditional hard rock and heavy metal songs, incorporating elements of punk rock, while adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal songs of the 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. Aesthetically glam metal draws heavily on the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy clothing and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided with the rise of the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.\n<br><br>\nThe genre rapidly lost mainstream interest from 1991 to 1993 with the rise of grunge and the release of albums such as Nirvana's Nevermind. It experienced a partial resurgence around the turn of the century, due in part to increased interest on the internet, with the successful 'Glam Slam Metal Jam' music festival taking place in summer 2000.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. The genre itself was defined as a separate movement from punk rock during the early 1980s largely due to the significant stylistic divergences of the movement; gothic rock, as opposed to punk, combines dark, often keyboard-heavy music with introspective and depressing lyrics. \n<br><br>\nIn 1976, Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice was published. The main character, although dark, wanted companionship and love. The book, according to music journalist Dave Thompson, slowly created an audience for gothic rock by word of mouth. The same year saw the punk rock band The Damned debut. The group's vocalist Dave Vanian was a former gravedigger who dressed like a vampire 24 hours a day. Brian James, a guitarist for the group, noted, \"Other groups had safety pins and the spitting and bondage trousers, but you went to a Damned show, and half the local cemetery would be propped up against the stage\". Gothic rock gave rise to a broader goth subculture that includes clubs, fashion and numerous publications that grew in popularity in the 1980s.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Gothic metal or goth metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that combines the aggression of doom metal with the dark melancholy of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of doom/death, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally melodramatic and mournful with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences.\n<br><br>\nNorwegian band Theatre of Tragedy developed the \"beauty and the beast\" aesthetic of combining aggressive male vocals with clean female vocals, a contrast that has since been adopted by many gothic metal groups. During the mid-1990s, a number of bands brought the gothic approach to black metal. By the end of the decade, a symphonic metal variant of gothic metal had been developed.\n<br><br>\nIn the 21st century, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where a number of groups have released hit singles or chart-topping albums. In the US, however, only a few bands such as HIM, Lacuna Coil, and Evanescence have found commercial success.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Grindcore is a genre of music that started in the early- to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive music genres – including death metal, industrial music, noise and the more extreme varieties of hardcore punk.\n<br><br>\nGrindcore is characterized by heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, high speed tempi, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched screams. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.\n<br><br>\nAn infamous trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\". Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. British band Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second \"You Suffer\" (1987). Many bands record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.\n<br><br>\nA variety of \"microgenres\" have subsequently emerged, often used to label bands according to alternative traits that deviate from standard grindcore, including goregrind, focused on horror themes, and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Other offshoots include noisegrind (especially raw and chaotic) and electrogrind (incorporating electronic elements). Although an influential phenomenon on hardcore punk and other popular genres, grindcore itself remains an underground form of music.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Tommy Victor of Prong claims that the attitude of groove metal came from Bad Brains.\n<br><br>\nGeoffrey Himes of The Washington Post described the music in 1998, as a \"marriage of hard rock with dance music and hip-hop\"; and stated about groove metal: \"This gives the loud, crunchy guitars a black-flavored dance pulse and gives the wailing vocals the punchy rhythms of rap and funk. Other groove metal bands have incorporated thrash metal, hardcore punk and industrial music. Ian Christe credits Sepultura's Chaos A.D. and Pantera for creating the death metal-derived music of groove metal and influencing later groups in the genre during the 1990s.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Inspired by hardcore punk, heavy metal, and indie rock, grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars, contrasting song dynamics, and apathetic or angst-filled lyrics. The grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared to other forms of rock music, and many grunge musicians were noted for their unkempt appearances and rejection of theatrics.\n<br><br>\nThe early grunge movement coalesced around Seattle independent record label Sub Pop in the late 1980s. Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of hard rock music at the time. However, many grunge bands were uncomfortable with this popularity. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, their influence continues to affect modern rock music.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Hardcore is generally faster, thicker, and heavier than earlier punk rock. The origin of the term hardcore punk is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, Hardcore '81.\n<br><br>\nHardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated submovements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved with the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s, and with the do it yourself (DIY) ethos in underground music scenes. It has influenced several music genres which have experienced mainstream success, such as: metalcore, grunge, thrash metal, emo and post-hardcore.\n<br><br>\nHardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s — particularly in Washington, D.C., California, New York/New Jersey, and Boston — as well as in the United Kingdom. While traditional hardcore has never experienced mainstream commercial success, some of its early pioneers have garnered appreciation over time.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Hard rock (or heavy rock) is a loosely defined genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage rock, blues rock and psychedelic rock. Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music. The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis.\n<br><br>\nIn the late 1960s the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity. While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them.\n<br><br>\nHard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Van Halen, and reached a commercial peak in the mid 1980s. The glam metal of bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses followed up with great success in the later part of that decade, before losing popularity in the face of grunge. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post punk revival.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Heavy metal (often referred to simply as metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues-rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity and machismo.\n<br><br>\nIn the late 1960s the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity. While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them.\n<br><br>\nLed Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant's dramatic, wailing vocals. Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, \"purely\" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath (Black Sabbath and Paranoid) were crucial in this regard. Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering. Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style.\n<br><br>\nJudas Priest arrived to unify and amplify the heavy metal aesthetic from hard rock's sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself. Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the U.S. until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a nonbluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.\n<br><br>\nMany subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during and after the 1980s.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The \"one-man-band\" Nine Inch Nails helped it gain a mass audience.\n<br><br>\nIndustrial metal's popularity led to some criticism from other artists associated with the industrial scene. Subsequently, it is most well-known in various European permutations. Industrial metal groups are known to have produced many acclaimed music videos.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The term mathcore is suggested by analogy with math rock. Both math rock and mathcore make use of unusual time signatures. Math rock groups have some influence on mathcore, though mathcore is more closely related to metalcore. Prominent mathcore groups have been associated with grindcore.\n<br><br>\nAn early antecedent to mathcore was practiced by Black Flag, in 1984, with the album My War: \"Its seven-minute metal dirges and fusion-style time signatures proved too much for many fans\". Many groups from the mathcore scene paid tribute to Black Flag for the album Black on Black.\n<br><br>\nStewart-Panko described the sound of these bands as a \"dynamic, violent, discordant, technical, brutal, off-kilter, no rules mixture of metal, hardcore, prog, math rock, grind and jazz.\" However, this term also describes an earlier, more dissonant variant of grindcore, also known as \"noisegrind\", that is less complex and dynamic than the groups subsequently labeled mathcore.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcore\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Bands in the genre are known to supplement their sound with a wide range of folk and traditional instruments.

The genre is also known as Gothenburg metal, a reference to the city in Sweden where it originated. Originally the genre combined the harmony style and groove melodies of heavy metal with the harsh thrashing sound and vocals of death metal. Later the genre evolved due to many different influences; a notable evolution in the genre being the addition of keyboards. Melodic death metal contains more melodic guitar riffs, melodic solos, and occasionally acoustic guitar work rather than traditional death metal.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_death_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Power metal is today associated with fast tempo and melodic harmonies, the sound tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal's musical forerunner. Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with \"clean\" vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with death metal and black metal. Following in the tradition of Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register. The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range, capable of hitting very high notes. \n<br><br>\nHelloween one of Melodic power metal's originators mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals. Stratovarius further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards. This genre spread over Europe, often incorporating further influences from classical and folk music. The style has become one of the most popular metal subgenres, and has many bands outside of Europe.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_metal#European_power_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The term took on its current meaning in the mid-1990s. The earliest of these groups, Integrity, began performing in 1988. Metalcore is distinguished from other punk metal fusions by its emphasis on breakdowns: slower, intense passages conducive to moshing. The vocalizing technique in metalcore is generally screamed vocals, particularly common among many 1990s metalcore groups. Today many metalcore bands combine screaming vocals with the usage of clean vocals usually during the bridge or chorus of a song. The genre has had a saturation of bands in the last five years. Sepultura has been credited to \"lay the foundation\" for the genre. \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

It refers to a very technical performance consisting of elements borrowed from both classical and heavy metal music. Yngwie Malmsteen, the most notable musician in the sub-genre, contributed greatly to the development of the style in the 1980s.\n<br><br>\nThe \"golden age\" of neo-classical metal in the middle to late 1980s revolved around the sizable roster of flashy electric-guitar soloists who recorded mostly instrumental albums for Mike Varney's Shrapnel Records label. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, widely regarded as the originator and still-reigning king of neo-classical metal, was brought to the United States by Varney to sign with Shrapnel Records in 1982. Malmsteen drew influence from both rock and classical idioms from a young age in developing his hyper-amplified, hyper-fast technique on the electric guitar; Malmsteen's style in turn inspired countless imitators from the moment his earliest Shrapnel recordings appeared.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-classical_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The lyrics are generally in German. It uses the basic setup of instruments for metal, electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals, with keyboard, synthesisers and samples. Emphasis is on a demonstration of predominance, by over-pronouncing certain syllables and letters (such as the uvular trill).

    "description": "The Second Wave of black metal emerged in the early 1990s and was largely centred on the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1994 a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing black metal music.\n<br><br>\nMusically, these artists developed the style of their 1980s precursors into a distinct genre that was separate from thrash metal. Philosophically, an aggressive anti-Christian sentiment became a must for any artists to be labelled as \"black metal\". Ihsahn of Emperor believes that this trend may have developed simply from \"an opposition to society, a confrontation to all the normal stuff.\" A dark, misanthropic mentality was complemented visually with the use of corpsepaint, which was also most prevalent during this period as a statement to separate black metal artists from other rock bands of the era.\n<br><br>\nSome of these artists would be responsible for a rash of criminal controversy, including church burnings and murder. On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist Per Yngve \"Pelle\" Ohlin (aka 'Dead') committed suicide in a house shared by the band. Fellow musicians often described Ohlin as a quiet and introverted person, while his performances involved cutting himself, carrying around a dead crow, and wearing clothes that had been buried weeks prior to the event. Photographs of his body were later used as the cover of a bootleg live album entitled Dawn of the Black Hearts. Members and fans of the black metal scene claimed responsibility for over 50 arsons directed at Christian churches in Norway from 1992 to 1996. Many of the buildings were hundreds of years old, and widely regarded as important historical landmarks. On 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes of Burzum murdered Mayhem guitarist Øystein Aarseth (aka 'Euronymous'). On that night, Vikernes and Snorre Ruch of Thorns travelled from Bergen to Aarseth's apartment in Oslo. Upon their arrival a confrontation began, which ended when Vikernes fatally stabbed Aarseth. His body was found outside the apartment with twenty-three cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back. Vikernes was arrested within days, and a few months later was sentenced to 21 years in prison for both the murder and church arsons.\n<br><br>\nBy the mid 1990s, the musical style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands across the globe. Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instrumentation such as synthesizers and full-symphony orchestras. This expansion and diversification marked the end of the Second Wave.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal#The_Second_Wave\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Nu metal (also known as nü-metal or aggro-metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal. It is a fusion genre which combines elements of heavy metal with other genres, including grunge and hip hop. The genre gained mainstream success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n<br><br>\nThe origin of \"nu metal\" is often adjudicated to the work of producer Ross Robinson, who worked with acts such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, producing their first albums and helping create the sound that defined them. He has even been called \"The Godfather of Nu Metal\".\n<br><br>\nKorn is often acknowledged as a reference for the nu-metal style of music. They released their first self-titled album in 1994, but they did not gain mainstream popularity until years later. The most \"pure\" form of nu-metal is considered to be the one contained in their second studio album, Life is Peachy. Nu metal gained mainstream success through MTV and Ozzy Osbourne's 1995 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal. Also, the 30th anniversary of Woodstock (Woodstock 99) featured nu metal bands, notably Korn and Limp Bizkit. The Family Values Tour is the most widely recognized tour meant mainly for nu-metal bands.\n<br><br>\nNu metal album sales declined and rotation of nu metal artists on rock radio began to diminish in the early 2000's. Several factors contributed to this, including oversaturation of the market, and a negative stigma associated with the genre.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Some of the bands considered part of the movement had formed as early as the late 1980s, but did not become influential or reach popular standing until the following decade. The term NWOAHM is a later reference to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement of the very early 1980s.\n<br><br>\nAlthough the term is used by the media with increasing frequency, the definition has not been finished completely. This is due in part to the growing addition of bands that assimilate to common styles in NWOAHM, yet have not differentiated greatly enough as to garner a new genre moniker. One descriptor by longtime metal author Garry Sharpe-Young helps classify the NWOAHM as a \"marriage of European-style riffing and throaty vocals\". Several of the bands within the NWOAHM are credited with bringing heavy metal back into the mainstream.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_American_Heavy_Metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "The New Wave of British Heavy Metal (frequently abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a heavy metal movement that started in the late 1970s, in Britain, and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. The movement developed as a reaction in part to the decline of early heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. NWOBHM bands toned down the blues influences of earlier acts, incorporated elements of punk, increased the tempo, and adopted a \"tougher\" sound, taking a harder approach to its music. It was a scene directed almost exclusively at heavy metal fans. The era is considered to be a major foundation stone for the extreme metal genres; acts such as the American Thrash Metal band Metallica cite NWOBHM bands like Saxon, Motörhead, Diamond Head, and Iron Maiden as a major influence on their musical style.\n<br><br>\nReviled or ignored by many mainstream critics in both the UK and the US, the NWOBHM nonetheless came to dominate the hard rock scene of the early-mid 1980s. NWOBHM was musically characterized by fast upbeat tempo songs, power chords, fast guitar solos and melodic, soaring vocals, with lyrical themes often drawing inspiration from mythology and fantasy fiction. Many of the bands of this era were signed to Neat Records, who has released volumes of NWOBHM compilations in later years.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_British_Heavy_Metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Post-metal is a music genre, a mixture between the genres of post-rock and heavy metal. It is broadly characterized by downtuned, distorted guitar(s), heavy atmospherics, gradual evolution of song structure, and a minimal emphasis on vocals.\n<br><br>\nHydra Head Records owner and Isis frontman Aaron Turner originally termed the genre \"thinking man's metal\", demonstrating that his band was trying to move away from common metal conventions. \"Post-metal\" is the favored name for the growing genre, but it is also referred to as \"metalgaze\" and \"steel\".\n<br><br>\nJournalist Simon Reynolds writes that \"the term post-metal seems increasingly useful to describe the vast and variegated swath of genres that emerged from the early '90s onward. Sometimes beat-free and ambient, increasingly the work of home-studio loners rather than performing bands, post-metal of the kind released by labels like Hydra Head often seems to have barely any connection to metal as understood by, say, VH1 Classic doc-makers. The continuity is less sonic but attitudinal: the penchant for morbidity and darkness taken to a sometimes hokey degree; the somber clothing and the long hair; the harrowed, indecipherably growled vocals; the bombastically verbose lyrics/song titles/band names. It's that aesthetic rather than a way of riffing or a palette of guitar sounds that ties post-metal back to Judas Priest and Black Sabbath.\"\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Post-rock is a subgenre of alternative rock characterized by the use of instruments commonly associated with rock music, but using rhythms, harmonies, melodies, timbres, and chord progressions not traditionally found in rock. Post-rock musicians typically produce instrumental music.\n<br><br>\nDon Caballero and Tortoise were among the more prominent bands described as post-rock in the 1990s, but their styles are very different, despite being instrumental bands centered on guitars and drums. As such, the term has been the subject of backlash from listeners and artists alike. The term \"post-rock\" is believed to have been coined by critic Simon Reynolds in his review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, published in the March 1994 issue of Mojo magazine. Reynolds expanded upon the idea later in the May 1994 issue of The Wire.\n<br><br>\nHe used the term to describe music \"using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords\". He further expounded on the term, \"Perhaps the really provocative area for future development lies... in cyborg rock; not the wholehearted embrace of Techno's methodology, but some kind of interface between real time, hands-on playing and the use of digital effects and enhancement.\"\n<br><br>\nReynolds, in a July 2005 entry in his blog, claimed he had used the term \"post-rock\" before using it in Mojo, previously using it in music newspaper Melody Maker. He also said he later found the term to not be of his own creation, saying in his blog, \"although I genuinely believed I was coining the term, I discovered many years later it had been floating around for over a decade.\" The term was used by American journalist James Wolcott in a 1975 article about musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning. It was also used in the Rolling Stone Album Guide to name a style roughly corresponding to \"avant-rock\" or \"out-rock\".\n<br><br>\nAlthough firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s and '90s, post-rock's style often bears little resemblance musically to that of indie rock.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Many progressive metal bands are also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music. Like progressive rock songs, progressive metal songs are typically much longer than standard metal songs, and are often thematically linked in concept albums.\n<br><br>\nAlthough progressive metal and avant-garde metal both favor experimentation and non-standard ideas, there are rather large differences between the two genres. The experimentation of progressive metal has a strong emphasis on technicality and theoretical complexity (influenced by jazz music). This is done by playing complex rhythms and implementing unusual time signatures and song structures - all with the use of traditional instruments. For avant-garde metal, most of the experimentation is in the use of unusual sounds and instruments - being more unorthodox and questioning of musical conventions.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

It emerged during the mid 1960s among folk rock and blues-rock bands in United States and the United Kingdom. It often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such the ragas and drones of Indian music. Psychedelic rock bridged the transition from early blues- and folk music-based rock to progressive rock, glam rock, hard rock and as a result influenced the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Punk rock is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.\n<br><br>\nBy late 1976, bands such as the Ramones, in New York City, and the Sex Pistols and The Clash, in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Shock rock is a wide umbrella term for artists who combine rock music with elements of theatrical shock value in live performances. With a career spanning the mid-1960s to recent years, American band leader Alice Cooper, inspired by such artists as Arthur Brown, refined shock rock, with expensive, upscale illusionary, graphic stunts, such as feigning decapitation with the use of elaborate special effects. In the early 1970s, Cooper's unique blend of heavy metal and folk-blues, complete with sardonic and inevitably controversial lyrics, proved a powerful inspiration for many future genre artists such as KISS of the mid 1970s, Glam metal of the '80s and Marilyn Manson of the 1990s. Alice Cooper is the one who has been credited for inventing true shock rock, as well as trade-marking shock rock.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_rock\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Sludge metal, or just sludge,[citation needed] is a subgenre of heavy metal that melds the slow tempos, heavy rhythms and dark, pessimistic atmosphere of doom metal with the aggression, shouted vocals and occasional fast tempos of hardcore punk. As The New York Times put it, \"The shorthand term for the kind of rock descending from early Black Sabbath and late Black Flag is sludge, because it's so slow and dense.\" Sludge metal is typically abrasive; often featuring shouted vocals, heavily distorted instruments and sharply contrasting tempos. While the style was anticipated by the Melvins from Washington, many of its earliest pioneers were from the state of Louisiana.\n<br><br>\nMany sludge metal bands from the Southern United States incorporate Southern rock and blues influence, although not all sludge bands share this style. There is some controversy as to whether the term refers to only the style emerging from New Orleans and later the American South more broadly, or to \"a complete consciousness in the heads of like-minded Black Flag/Black Sabbath influenced scenes and individuals all over the world\". So-called \"atmospheric\" sludge bands adopt a more experimental approach and compose music with an ambient atmosphere, reduced aggression and philosophical lyrics. Due to the similarities between sludge and stoner metal, there is often a crossover between the two genres, but sludge metal generally avoids stoner metal's usage of psychedelia. Sludge metal also bears some musical and lyrical resemblance to crust punk, due to the usage of political lyrics and thick, \"dirty\" guitar sounds.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sludge_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The Brazillian Thrash metal scene was one of the major scenes of thrash metal in the 1980s. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the scene had some of the most extreme bands, close to what became known as death metal. Bands such as Sepultura, Sarcófago and Mutilator continued further and were in some ways more extreme than the German Teoutonic thrash. The band Sarcófago has influenced most of the European black metal and death metal bands. In the late 80s Brazillian band Sepultura had success outside of Brazil. \n<br><br>\nColombian bands such as Parabellum and Reencarnacion had a big influence on the underground black/death metal scene worldwide including an influence on Norwegian black metal band Mayhem.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Brazilian_death_metal_musical_groups\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Speed metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from NWOBHM and hardcore punk roots. It is described as \"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\" music.\n<br><br>\nMotörhead is often credited as the first band to invent/play speed metal. Some of speed metal's earlier influences include Deep Purple's \"Fireball\" and Queen's \"Stone Cold Crazy\", from their 1974 album Sheer Heart Attack, and Deep Purple's song \"Highway Star\", from their album Machine Head. The latter was called 'early speed metal' by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil. Led Zeppelin's \"Communication Breakdown\", first released in January 1969, could also be said to be an early template for speed metal.\n<br><br>\nSpeed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal. Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, there is a distinct difference between them. In his book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, Ian Christe states that \"...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal.\"\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Stoner metal bands updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Blue Öyster Cult, and Hawkwind by filtering their psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through the buzzing sound of early Sub Pop-style grunge. The genre emerged during the early 1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. \n<br><br>\nA number of bands have combined stoner metal with typical sludge metal traits such as Bongzilla and High on Fire.

    "description": "Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. While Norway is more notorious for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic death metal scene, while Stockholm is notorious for its rawer death metal scene.\n<br><br>\nThe death metal scene in Sweden has influenced many bands and genres outside Sweden. The melodic influence of the Gothenburg sound has spread to the United States to more hardcore punk and metalcore groups. The Stockholm Sound has been known to be very influenced by the first Entombed album as bands such as Autopsy, Death and Repulsion. The Stockholm Sound has less reception. Melodic death metal, on the other hand has had a notable influence on the melodic metalcore sound of the 2000's.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_death_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Symphonic black metal is a style of black metal that uses symphonic and orchestral elements that emerged in Europe in the mid to late 1990s. Symphonic black metal may include the usage of melodic instruments found in the sections of a symphony orchestra (string instruments, brass instruments, woodwinds and keys). Vocals can be \"clean\" or operatic in style, song structures are more defined or are inspired by symphonies. However, much of the characteristics of \"traditional\" black metal are retained, such as shrieked vocals, fast tempos and high-pitched electric guitars often played with tremolo picking. \n<br><br>\nThe sound is not always literally symphonic; that simply refers to the thick-sounding instrumentation and arpeggios, dramatic soundscapes. Nor is its connection to black metal always readily audible; although nearly all of symphonic black metal bands started out playing standard black metal, symphonic black metal often bears little surface resemblance to its immediate forebear. Black metal groups began emphasizing the guitar and adding elements of progressive rock (primarily psychedelic rock and space rock) and gothic metal, with its emphasis on a chilling, eerie texture. The result is a sound usually lush, and much more accessible than standard black metal. The symphonic black metal movement remains somewhat limited, partly because of its epic ambitions and partly because it isn't traditionally metallic, but its fascinating synthesis of influences made it an instantly identifiable alternative.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_black_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Technical death metal (sometimes called tech death) is a musical subgenre of death metal that focuses on complex rhythms, riffs and song structures. Technical experimentation in death metal began in the late '80s and early '90s. In 1989, Atheist's debut album Piece of Time was released, followed by Nocturnus' The Key, in 1990. In 1991, Death released Human. This and later Death albums have proven influential on '90s technical death metal bands. In 1991, New York's grindcore-influenced Suffocation released the Effigy of the Forgotten debut album, which focused on speed and brutality with \"sophisticated\" sense of songwriting and subsequently became groundbreaking in the genre.\n<br><br>\nPhil Freeman, ex-editor of Metal Edge, has described the sub-genre of technical death metal as \"the hidden side of its genre, having more in common with prog-rock and jazz fusion than with the mechanistic, Satan-obsessed grinding that's the music's dominant public image.\" Often technical death metal albums feature exotic or sci-fi imagery.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_death_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Thrash metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is characterized usually by its fast tempo and aggression. Songs of the genre typically use fast percussive and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. Lyrics of thrash metal songs often deal with social issues using direct and denunciatory language, an approach which partially overlaps with the hardcore genre. The \"Big Four\" bands of thrash metal are Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer, who simultaneously created and popularized the genre in the early 1980s.\n<br><br>\nThe origins of thrash metal are generally traced to the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a number of bands began incorporating the sound of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, creating a new genre and developing into a separate movement from punk rock and hardcore. This genre is more aggressive compared to its relative, speed metal, and can be seen in part to be a reaction to the lighter, more widely acceptable sounds and themes of glam metal.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

The first black metal albums to promote Christianity were Antestor's Martyrium (1994) and Horde's Hellig Usvart (1994) – the latter coined the term unblack metal.

    "description": "American Power Metal emerged in 1980s United States, drawing its influences mainly from speed metal and the NWOBHM. Though very close to its roots, US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster than standard heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach than its later European counterpart, but more melodic and often with a higher emphasis on guitar leads than thrash. Another notable difference is the relative lack of keyboards in American power metal, in contrast to their almost universal presence in the European variety. USPM is also notable for its wide (but not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late 80s and early 90s. Many major US power metal bands, such as Fates Warning, were also pivotal in pioneering the progressive metal genre. US power metal saw a sharp decline in popularity at the beginning of the 90s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_metal#American_power_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Viking metal is \"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies.\" Like folk metal bands, Viking metal acts \"generally utilize some acoustic and other unusual instruments in addition to the traditional metal instruments.\"\n<br><br>\nThe genre of Viking metal was pioneered by the Swedish band Bathory. The band's fourth album Blood Fire Death was released in 1988 and includes two early examples of Viking metal – the songs \"A Fine Day to Die\" and \"Blood Fire Death\". Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic describes this as \"possibly the first true example\" of Viking metal. It was followed in 1990 with the release of Hammerheart, a landmark album that \"formally introduced\" to the metal world the \"archetypical Viking metal album.\" By then the band had completely departed from \"the Satanic mould\" and was \"squarely in Viking mythology.\" The Viking metal music of Bathory was characterised by Wagnerian \"lengthy epics, ostentatious arrangements, chorused vocals, and ambient keyboards.\"\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "description": "Visual kei (literally \"visual style\") refers to a movement among Japanese musicians, that is characterized by the use of make-up, elaborate hair styles and flamboyant costumes, often, but not always, coupled with androgynous aesthetics. Some sources state that Visual Kei refers to a music genre, or to a sub-genre of J-rock (a term referring to Japanese rock in general), with its own particular sound, related to glam-rock, punk and metal. However other sources state that Visual Kei's unique clothing, make-up, fashions, and participation in the related sub-culture is equally as important as the sound of the music itself in the use of the term.\n<br><br>\nVisual Kei emerged in the late 1980s pioneered by bands such as X Japan, D'erlanger, Buck-Tick, and Color. The term Visual Kei was created with one of X Japan's slogans \"Psychedelic violence crime of visual shock\". Color vocalist \"Dynamite Tommy\" formed his record company Free-Will in 1986, which has been a major contributor in spreading modern Visual Kei outside Japan. In 1992, X Japan launched an attempt to enter the European and American markets, but it would take another 8 years until popularity and awareness of Visual Kei bands would extend worldwide. \n<br><br>\nIn the mid 1990s, Visual Kei received an increase in popularity throughout Japan, and album sales from Visual Kei bands started to reach record numbers. The most notable bands to achieve success during this period included X Japan, Glay, and Luna Sea; however, a drastic change in their appearance accompanied their success. By 1999, mainstream popularity in Visual Kei was declining; X Japan had disbanded, and the death of lead guitarist Hideto Matsumoto in 1998 had denied fans a possible reunion. Soon after, in 2000, Luna Sea decided to disband.\n<br><br>\nIn 2007 the genre was revitalized, as Luna Sea performed a one-off performance, and X Japan reunited for a new single and a world tour. With these developments, Visual Kei bands enjoyed a boost in public awareness, described by the media as \"Neo-Visual Kei\". New bands have big popularity today, and new bands still use Visual Kei as a reference of themselves.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

Around the world, Deathrash is the moniker for the bands following these attributes.",

    "description": "Folk metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal with traditional folk music. This includes the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles.\n<br>\nThe earliest exponent of folk metal was the English band Skyclad. Their debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1990. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe as well as in Israel. Among these early groups, the Irish band Cruachan and the German band Subway to Sally each spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as Celtic metal and medieval metal respectively. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.\n<br>\nThe music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with paganism, nature, fantasy, mythology and history.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",

    "title": "Symphonic Metal",
    "description": "Symphonic metal is a term used to describe heavy metal music that has symphonic elements; that is, elements that are either borrowed from classical music or, as with progressive rock music, create a style reminiscent of it, e.g. operatic female lead vocals; instrumentation that includes acoustic guitars and different types of keyboards instead of relying solely on electric guitars; classical thematic material in addition to characteristically heavy metal power riffs.\n<br>\nThe roots of symphonic metal are found in early death metal and gothic metal bands, who made some use of symphonic elements in their music. Particularly important was Therion's use of a live orchestra and classical compositional techniques; gradually these elements became a more important part of Therion's music than their death metal roots. Another key early influence was Finnish progressive metal band Waltari's album Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! Death Metal Symphony in Deep C.\n<br>\nNightwish and Within Temptation both released their first albums in 1997, each heavily influenced by Therion's symphonic turn. Within Temptation was more influenced by gothic metal, and therefore musically simpler than the more power metal-influenced Nightwish, but both bands shared two key symphonic metal elements - powerful female lead vocals from Tarja Turunen and Sharon den Adel respectively, and the heavy use of classically influenced keyboard playing.\n<br>\nMany new symphonic metal bands appeared or came to wide attention in the early 2000s, including Rain Fell Within, After Forever, Epica, Haggard, and Edenbridge, all featuring the characteristic keyboards and female vocals. Power metal, with its relatively upbeat fantasy themes and stylized keyboard sounds, tended to be an important influence on these groups.\n<br>\nThe term \"symphonic metal\" has sometimes been applied to individual songs or albums by bands that are primarily death metal, doom metal, gothic metal, power metal, or even black metal. While this article has mainly discussed symphonic metal as a distinct subgenre, it is worth noting that the term is sometimes used to describe stylistic elements that can be found in nearly any heavy metal sub-genre.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",
