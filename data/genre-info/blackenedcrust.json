  "title": "Blackened crust",
  "description": "Blackened crust is a style that combines elements of black metal with crust punk. The earliest crust punk groups, such as Amebix, were also inspired by bands such as Venom and Celtic Frost, while Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk as well as metal. In the 1990s, some crust punk groups began to incorporate elements of \"Norwegian black metal\". Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk. Iskra coined their own phrase \"blackened crust\" to describe this new style.<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal#Stylistic_divisions\">(Source)</a>",
