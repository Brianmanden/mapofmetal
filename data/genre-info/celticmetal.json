  "description": "Celtic metal is a subgenre of folk metal that developed in the 1990s in Ireland. As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal music and Celtic music. The early pioneers of the genre were the three Irish bands Cruachan, Primordial and Waylander. The genre has since expanded beyond Irish shores and is known to be performed today by bands from numerous other countries.\n<br><br>\nSimilar to its parent genre of folk metal, the music of Celtic metal is a diverse collection with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music. While bands some bands ply their trade with the more extreme subgenres of black or death metal, other groups prefer a more traditional or power metal sound. The one common element is a shared interest in incorporating Celtic music into heavy metal.\n<br><br>\nMany bands in the genre enhance their sound with the use of a folk instrument. Such as the fiddle, the tin whistle and the flute. A number of the Irish bands of the genre make use of native instruments such as the uilleann pipe and bodhrán.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_metal\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",
