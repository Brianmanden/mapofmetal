  "description": "Garage rock is a raw form of rock and roll that was first popular in the United States and Canada from about 1963 to 1967. During the 1960s, it was not recognized as a separate music genre and had no specific name. In the late 1970s, some rock critics retroactively identified it as an early incarnation of punk rock, and it is sometimes called garage punk, protopunk, or 1960s punk; however, the music style has predominantly been referred to as garage rock.\n<br><br>\nThe garage rock performances were most of the time characterized as being amateurish or na√Øve. Common themes were related to the negative aspects of high school life and the lyrics and delivery were quite a bit more aggressive than what was common at the time, often with growled or shouted vocals that often seemed to be more like screaming. A particularly common type of songs were songs about \"lying girls\". This might imply that the music was very limited. However, in reality different garage rock acts were quite diverse in both musical ability and in style. Bands varied from one-chord musical crudeness to near-studio musician quality. Also there were regional variations in many parts of the country with the Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon having the most defined regional sound.\n<br><br>\nBy 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and the local level as new styles had evolved to replace garage rock and since the music industry stopped supporting it. The only exception was in Detroit where garage rock stayed alive until the early 70s, however, with a much more aggressive style. These bands are often described as proto-punk or proto-hard rock.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://ezinearticles.com/?The-History-of-Garage-Rock&id=1939795\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",
