  "title": "Visual Kei",
  "description": "Visual kei (literally \"visual style\") refers to a movement among Japanese musicians, that is characterized by the use of make-up, elaborate hair styles and flamboyant costumes, often, but not always, coupled with androgynous aesthetics. Some sources state that Visual Kei refers to a music genre, or to a sub-genre of J-rock (a term referring to Japanese rock in general), with its own particular sound, related to glam-rock, punk and metal. However other sources state that Visual Kei's unique clothing, make-up, fashions, and participation in the related sub-culture is equally as important as the sound of the music itself in the use of the term.\n<br><br>\nVisual Kei emerged in the late 1980s pioneered by bands such as X Japan, D'erlanger, Buck-Tick, and Color. The term Visual Kei was created with one of X Japan's slogans \"Psychedelic violence crime of visual shock\". Color vocalist \"Dynamite Tommy\" formed his record company Free-Will in 1986, which has been a major contributor in spreading modern Visual Kei outside Japan. In 1992, X Japan launched an attempt to enter the European and American markets, but it would take another 8 years until popularity and awareness of Visual Kei bands would extend worldwide. \n<br><br>\nIn the mid 1990s, Visual Kei received an increase in popularity throughout Japan, and album sales from Visual Kei bands started to reach record numbers. The most notable bands to achieve success during this period included X Japan, Glay, and Luna Sea; however, a drastic change in their appearance accompanied their success. By 1999, mainstream popularity in Visual Kei was declining; X Japan had disbanded, and the death of lead guitarist Hideto Matsumoto in 1998 had denied fans a possible reunion. Soon after, in 2000, Luna Sea decided to disband.\n<br><br>\nIn 2007 the genre was revitalized, as Luna Sea performed a one-off performance, and X Japan reunited for a new single and a world tour. With these developments, Visual Kei bands enjoyed a boost in public awareness, described by the media as \"Neo-Visual Kei\". New bands have big popularity today, and new bands still use Visual Kei as a reference of themselves.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",
