  "description": "There is something about Greek Black Metal that is primitive yet classy. Varathron are perhaps the oldest and best known Greek Black Metal band. Their first demo tape in 1989 called Procreation of the Unaltered Evil is the larval stage of what would become a legendary name in Hellenic darkness. Teenage occult metal from the Hellenic Republic, the land that brought us olives, democracy, and Yanni.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://cosmichearse.blogspot.com/2009/01/black-metal-ist-greek.html\" target=\"_blank\">(Source)</a>",
